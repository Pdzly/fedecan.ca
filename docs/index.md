    Lemmy.ca is a federated link aggregator, similar to Reddit. It is a place to share links, discuss topics, and engage with others. 
    
    As of April 2024, we have over **7400 users** and **600 communities**. Since Lemmy is a federated platform, you can also connect to thousands of other instances including Mastodon, Kbin, and more.

    As we grow, we plan to expand our services to include other federated platforms. Stay tuned for more information!

    ---

    The **Fediverse** is a network of websites that can all communicate with each other. Similar to email, you can have an account on one website and still interact with people on other websites. This limits the power of any single website or company, and allows for more freedom and diversity online.

-   :octicons-tools-24:{ .lg .middle } __Why is Open Source software important?__

    ---

    **Open Source** software is created by a community of developers in a manner that is transparent and open to everyone. Often this allows for anyone to contribute to the software, understand how it works, and use it for free.
