# Welcome!

We are dedicated to providing platforms for Canadians to engage in online communities through 'federated' software. We are committed to providing a safe and inclusive space for all Canadians to connect and share ideas! See below for more information on what this means, what we are working on, and how you can get involved.

# What are we working on?

As we grow, we plan to expand our services to include other federated platforms. Below are some of the things we are currently working on!

    Lemmy.ca is a federated link aggregator, similar to Reddit. It is a place to share links, discuss topics, and engage with others. 
    
    As of April 2024, we have over **7400 users** and **600 communities**. Since Lemmy is a federated platform, you can also connect to thousands of other instances including Mastodon, Kbin, and more.
