    details: Traditional social media platforms base their decisions on maximizing profits. We registered as a non-profit to ensure that our decisions will always prioritize the best interests of our users.
  - title: Open Source & Open Standards
    icon: 
      src: /img/icons/server-edit.png
    details: Our platforms run open-source software, and use open standards like ActivityPub. Since anyone can inspect and contribute to the code, we can ensure that the platforms are secure, privacy respecting, and reliable.
  - title: A Federated Network

    details: The Fediverse enables many different and independent social media platforms to communicate with each other. By joining a Fediverse instance like ours, you can connect with users from thousands of other instances.
