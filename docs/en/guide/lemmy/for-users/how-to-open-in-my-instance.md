# How do I open something in my instance on Lemmy?

If you come across a community while browsing Lemmy normally, you can usually just join it by clicking the button on the community page.

However, if someone messages you a link or you find a link on some website (like the ones you will find on this page below), you will need to first open it in your instance.

A community link will have two parts, the name of the community and the instance that it is from. For example, `!canada@lemmy.ca` is the community `canada` on the instance `lemmy.ca`.

If you want to open this community on some other instance, such as `lemmy.world`, you would type in `https://lemmy.world/c/canada@lemmy.ca`.
