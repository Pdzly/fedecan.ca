# Faire un don

We are a non-profit organization and all of our platforms are sustained by donations from users like you. If you would like to support our work, please consider making a donation. 

While we are a registered non-profit organization, we are not a registered charity. As such, we are unable to provide tax receipts for donations. Please see our [FAQ](guide/fedecan/faq#_2-why-are-you-not-a-registered-charity) to read about why we did not pursue charitable status.

### Your contributions will help us:

- Maintain our servers and services
- Spin up new platforms for you to use
- Continue supporting your online experience, and the Fediverse as a whole
