# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. **What does it mean to be an incorporated not-for-profit organization?**

Being an incorporated not-for-profit organization means that we are legally recognized by the government of Canada such that:

- We **can not** organize or operate for the purpose of profit
- We are not a charity, nor do we operate exclusively for charitable purposes
- We must fulfill the requirements of the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act (NFP Act)

Simply put, this ensures that we CANNOT use our income or donations to personally benefit our members or directors, and that we will use all funds to sustain and grow our services.

We are incorporated federally in Canada, which means that we are recognized as a legal entity across the country. In addition, we are registered extra-provincially in British Columbia and this is the location of our registered office.

### 2. **Why are you not a registered charity?**
<!-- If this title is changed, the link in docs/donate.md and docs/donate-private.md must be updated as well. -->

We are a registered non-profit organization, but we are not a registered charity. This means that we are unable to provide tax receipts for donations.

While we may consider pursuing charitable status in the future, there are specific requirements that must be met, and only certain activities are considered "charitable purposes" by the government of Canada. We would need to carefully consider if pursuing charitable status is the right choice for this organization.
