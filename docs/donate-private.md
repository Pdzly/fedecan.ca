::: warning Privacy-focused page
This is the privacy-focused version of the donation page. It does not include any third-party embeds or header code, and only direct links to each of the donation platforms. To view the full donation page, please see [here](donate.md).
:::

We are a non-profit organization and all of our platforms are sustained by donations from users like you. If you would like to support our work, please consider making a donation. 

While we are a registered non-profit organization, we are not a registered charity. As such, we are unable to provide tax receipts for donations. Please see our [FAQ section](guide/fedecan/faq#_2-why-are-you-not-a-registered-charity) to read about why we are not currently pursuing charitable status.

### Your contributions will help us:

- Maintain our servers, platforms, and services
- Pay for operational costs to keep the non-profit running smoothly
- Spin up new platforms for you, to cover more of your social media needs
