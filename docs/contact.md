# Contact Us

The **best way to contact us** is by contacting us through Lemmy, by messaging [@admin@lemmy.ca](https://lemmy.ca/u/admin). Once we get set up, we will add an email address that you can also use to contact us.

While we have a phone number and mailing address, there may be significant delays in response time. We recommend using the above methods.
